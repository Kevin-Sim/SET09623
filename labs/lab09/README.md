# Lab 09: Bug Reporting and Tracking

In this lab we will setup a bug tracking template on GitHub.  This is actually such a common task there is already a tutorial:

Furthermore, you should use this opportunity to evaluate the health of your repository:

https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file

Finally, you should examine the use of labels to manage the state of a bug:
