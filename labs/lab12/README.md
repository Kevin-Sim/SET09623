# Lab 12: Final Delivery

This lab defines what you need to do for the final submission.  **You must follow these steps to receive a coursework grade for the module.**  We require a copy of your submission for moderation, and therefore you will have to submit your work as defined below.  You will also receive your final 20% grade for final delivery based on the completeness and quality of your submission.

## Step 1: Ensure You Have Submitted Your GitHub Repository Clone URL to Moodle and a zip of the final GitHub Repository

We will be performing a pull of your repository at the time of submission using an automated script.  **If you have not provided your GitHub link do so now.**  If you miss the cutoff date for link submission your repository will not be pulled and it will be counted as a none submission.  This is a one minute task.

## Step 2: Ensure Your Main Repository Readme Contains Correct Badges

We require the following badges on your GitHub repository to determine the status of your submission:

- Build status for `master`.
- Build status for `develop`.
- Code coverage of tests for `master`.
- Release name.
- License.

These badges will be clicked to ensure they are correct.  Incorrect badges provided will be penalised appropriately.

## Step 3: Your Main Repository Readme Details the Requirements Met

There are 32 requirements in total.  Your readme should state how many out of 32 have been met, and a percentage.  For example:

> 20 requirements of 32 have been implemented, which is 62.5%.

We then want evidence of each feature being met.  This will be in the form of a table (written in Markdown) with a screenshot from your application showing output that meets the requirements.  We require the following columns:

1. ID of the requirement.
2. Name of the requirement.
3. Has the requirement been met (Yes or No).
4. Screenshot.

For example:

| ID    | Name | Met  | Screenshot |
|-------|------|------|------------|
| 1     | All the countries in the world organised by largest population to smallest. | Yes | image |
| 2     | All the countries in a continent organised by largest population to smallest. | No |   |
| 3     | All the countries in a region organised by largest population to smallest. | Yes | image |

**Your submission will be checked to ensure this information is correct.  If incorrect information is provided this will be considered an act of academic misconduct by the group and dealt with accordingly.**

## Step 4: Ensure All the Above is on `master`

We will only assess your `master` branch.  Make sure that branch contains the version of your code you wish to submit.

## Step 5: Submit the final Individual Contribution Spreadsheet to Moodle

We wish to determine the individual contribution to the team project.  To do this, the team have to submit a single spreadsheet to Moodle defining the agreed contribution of each team member to the individual delivery points.  This should be submitted in percentages.  For example:

|      | Code Review 1 | Code Review 2 | Code Review 3 | Code Review 4 | Final Deliverable |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Name | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.2 |
| Name | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.4 |
| Name | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.2 |
| Name | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.2 |

The team need to agree these scores.  **If the team cannot agree, or a team member believes the spreadsheet submitted does not represent the actual contributions, then email the teaching team.**  In these circumstances, the metrics and other information provided on GitHub will be used.
